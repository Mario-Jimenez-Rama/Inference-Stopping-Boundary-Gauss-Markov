Software companion for my master thesis "Parametric Inference on the Optimal Stopping Boundary for Gauss-Markov Processes".

The title of each codes is pupose and the order in which it appears in the thesis.

There are 2 versions of the 3_estimated_distributions:
- The _M change the number of paths, M, to compare the asymptotic distribution of the estimates.
- The _N change the number of steps, N.
  In the thesis the 3_estimated_distributions_N was used.
